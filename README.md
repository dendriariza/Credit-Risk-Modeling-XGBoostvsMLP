# Predicting Corporate Default Risk Using Machine Learning

## A comparative study using Neural Networks (MLP) and XGBoost

This project builds machine learning models to predict the probability that a company will default using financial statement data.  
I used two different modeling approaches:  
- Neural Network (MLPClassifier)  
- XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)  
Both models learn patterns from real company financial ratios—such as leverage, profitability, liquidity, and firm size—to estimate the chance that a company might fail.  
The goal is to compare how each model performs and understand which one is more suitable for credit-risk prediction.
